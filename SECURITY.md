## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.


| Version | Supported         |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark:|

In version 1.0x we have implented our website to access an API that will check your emails to see if it's a phishing scam. 

Vulnerabilites: None dectected so far, but we fear we are at risk of our website being taken over by a third party.

Reporing Vulnerabilites: To report a vulnerability please email @phishing.edu and report the vulnerability you've detected. 

Expect an update on any reported vulnerabilites in 1-2 weeks, we like to make sure we have enough time to identify the issue and fix it before it becomes 
a reoccurring issue.
