<p>Hello all, Did you know that phishing attacks remain one of the biggest dangers on the internet today&quot;? - Forbes&nbsp; Phishing emails are one of the many common attack vectors that scammers, criminals, and hackers use to breach the security of your email, computer, and/or network. The name of the game for these individuals is the art of imitation, their goal to fool(phish) you into believing that they are a legitimate person sometimes in the form of a boss, advisor, the government, PII like social security numbers, or clicking on dummy links that will infect your system and possibly the entire network with malware.</p>
